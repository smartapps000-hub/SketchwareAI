# Architecture state

Verified facts about this fork, kept so they don't have to be rediscovered. Last updated for v1.8.0.

## Foundations (do not bypass)

- Fork of Sketchware Pro 6.4.0-rc05 (git base `966d905`); package `com.sketchware.ai`.
- Storage is the original layout: `/.sketchware/data/<sc_id>/{logic,view,file,library,resource}` (logic/view/file are AES/CBC, key = iv = `sketchwaresecure`), generated project in `/.sketchware/mysc/<sc_id>/`, local libraries in `/.sketchware/libs/local_libs/<name>/`.
- The block graph is the source of truth. Generated Java is derived and rewritten at every build (`mysc/<sc_id>` is deleted first). Build-time repairs therefore never persist in files; they are deterministic and re-applied at each build.
- Most of the core (`a.a.a.Fx` block-to-code, `eC` project data, `BlockPane`, `Rs` block view) exists only as compiled classes in `app/libs/*.jar`. They are used, not modified.
- Block ids: a block's id is the view tag it gets in the logic editor; it is kept across load/save of an event and is unique per event (not per project). A block is identified by activity + event key (`<targetId>_<eventName>`) + id.

## Phase 1 - Source Map Engine (done in v1.8.0)

`com.sketchware.ai.sourcemap`

- `SourceMapMarkers`: during a second, throw-away generation every statement block of every event/MoreBlock gets a marker block in front and behind (plain "add source directly" blocks whose code is a comment). The generator itself is not changed.
- `SourceMap.extract`: removes the markers and notes the lines. Hooked in `Jx.generateCode()` (activities) with `SourceMapMarkers.wrap` at the four block-to-code call sites (onCreate, events in `Hx`, adapters, MoreBlocks).
- Proof instead of trust: the map is kept only if the marked text minus markers equals the normal generation character for character, and (at `SourceMaps.finish`) only if the file on disk has the hash of that text. A lookup re-checks the hash (`SourceMaps.resolve`) or uses maps checked at the start of the compile step (`ErrorOrigins.session`). Anything else answers "generated source only"; a wrong block is never shown.
- Written per build by `yq.b()` to `mysc/<sc_id>/sourcemap.json`: per file `{file, sourceHash, generator, exact, events[{kind,targetId,eventName,start,end}], entries[{event, blockId, opCode, position, depth, start, end}]}`. Regenerated from the block graph each build, so it survives edits by construction; only activities whose code is generated are mapped.
- A saved log is tied to its map: the build's log ends with `(source map <file>@<hash prefix>)`; the compile log screen resolves a file only if the log names the map on disk, the file still has the map's hash, and the line on disk is the line the compiler quoted. An older log shown after a newer build gets no origins.
- Exports (`exportingProject`) make no source map and leave none in the exported folder.
- Consumers: failed build log gets "Where the errors come from"; auto-fix messages get the origin; the diagnostic sheet shows one card per Java error with Origin, **Open block** (logic editor opened on the event, block scrolled into view and ringed: extras `focus_block_id`, `focus_block_op`, `focus_line`) and **View source** (the file the compiler read, from disk, at the line: extras `path`, `line`).
- Not mapped: lines outside block code (fields, method headers, listener frames, imports), expression blocks on their own (they belong to their statement block), XML/layout lines, files replaced by custom Java, files rewritten by command blocks.

## Phase 2 - Build Map (first part in v1.8.0)

- `com.sketchware.ai.buildmap.BuildMap`: 13 tasks (prepare, generate, built-in libraries, AAPT2, Kotlin, Java, StringFog, ProGuard/R8, DEX, DEX merge, package, sign, install) with status and duration; errors and repair attempts for the failed task. `mysc/<sc_id>/buildmap.json`; printed at the end of a failed build's log.
- Missing: per-task inputs/outputs, warnings per task, cache (the build has none), AAB/zipalign/launch tasks, a dashboard screen.

## Existing repair engine (v1.7.x)

- `AutoHeal` (problem parser, located edits, never changes line count, rollback), `JavaTokens` (dead-code detection after JLS 14.22), `AutoHealLoop` (attempts, per-site escalation keep -> remove, report), `ClassIndex` (imports from the classpath), `LibraryAutoResolve`/`LibraryHeal` (enable installed library, known Maven coordinates, sub-dependency linking, D8), `BuildWarnings`.
- Order in `Dp.compileJavaCode()`: origin session -> pre-compile dead-code pass -> ECJ -> library rounds -> AutoHealLoop -> report.

## Not built

Phase 3 Build Doctor as a strategy-ID pipeline with result fingerprints, Phase 4 dashboard screen, Phase 5 repair history/memory on disk, Phase 6 Local Library Manager status display, Phase 7 Developer Tools controller, Project Brain, Git/GitHub, extensions, Android Studio import/export. A tamper/licence "security kit" is out of scope and will not be added.

## Rules carried from the directives

- Offline first; no cloud model in the build. Network only for Maven artifacts from Google Maven, Maven Central, JitPack. No scripts, Gradle hooks or unsigned plugins are ever downloaded or executed.
- No GitHub tokens/secrets in the APK, resources or project files.
- Permissions are never added silently.
- Project #639 is a regression fixture; no project id, block name or Bluetooth class is special-cased.
- A release note says "tested" only for what ran, and where (see compatibility-matrix.md).

## Repository notes

- `.gitignore` has an unanchored `build/` rule, so source folders named `build` are not tracked: `mod/hey/studios/build/`, `mod/jbk/build/` (and the flavors' `mod/jbk/build`). Three upstream files there are modified by this fork (`BuildSettings.java`, `BuildSettingsDialog.java`, `ResourceCompiler.java`); they are not in the patch series and ship as whole files in the patches zip under `overlay/`. Never put new code in a package folder named `build`.
